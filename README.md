Star Trek The Next Generation Dataset
================

I'VE MOVED ALL STAR TREK RELATED STUFF TO A NEW GITHUB ORGANIZATION: [RTREK](https://github.com/rtrek)

- STAR TREK TNG [COMPLETE DATASET ](https://github.com/RTrek/startrekTNGdataset)
- STARTREK PACKAGE [WHERE YOU CAN TALK LIKE THE CHARACTERS](https://github.com/RTrek/startrekpackage)
- MORE ABOUT [THE DATASET](https://github.com/RTrek/TNG)

TLDR
====

I'm a very nerdy person. I made a TNG dataset.

Short intro
===========

This repo contains the raw files, moviescripts from the sci-fi series Star Trek The Next Generation, R scripts to transform them and a dataset.

update
------

I have moved the dataset into it's own package download it with

``` r
devtools::install_github("RMHogervorst/TNG")
```

And find that page on <https://github.com/RMHogervorst/TNG> I'm very curious to see your analyses of TNG. Enjoy
