Star Trek The Next Generation Dataset
================

TLDR
====

I'm a very nerdy person. I made a TNG dataset.

Short intro
===========

This repo contains the raw files, moviescripts from the sci-fi series Star Trek The Next Generation, R scripts to transform them and a dataset.

update
------

I have moved the dataset into it's own package download it with

``` r
devtools::install_github("RMHogervorst/TNG")
```

And find that page on <https://github.com/RMHogervorst/TNG> I'm very curious to see your analyses of TNG. Enjoy
